# Third-party notices

Pactree software is licensed under MIT. The two legacy lexical data tables
below have separate terms; the MIT license does not replace those terms.
The table paths below refer to the sibling [Rust source repository](https://github.com/earldennison/pactree),
which supplies the native engine bundled in this Python package.
The tables support the legacy codec and conversion tools. PACTBIN2 storage
does not use them. Dictionary entries and their indices are unchanged here.

## English lexical data

`src/file_format/english_lexpack.rs` contains a selected and ordered Rust
string-table adaptation of English data from wordfreq 3.1.1.

wordfreq also describes aggregate word-frequency statistics collected from
Twitter. The table is lexical data, not a collection of messages or posts.

## Shell lexical data

`src/file_format/shell_lexpack.rs` combines shell tokens with selected command
examples adapted from [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

Copyright 2014-present the tldr-pages team and contributors. The adapted data

and [contributors](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/graphs/contributors).
Selection, ordering, and conversion into a Rust string table are modifications
made for the codec. No endorsement by tldr-pages is implied.
